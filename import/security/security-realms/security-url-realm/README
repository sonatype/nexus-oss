README:
This should be in jira, but if not, and you are thinking about using this Realm, read below:

This is a simple Realm that hits a URL, if the result of that request was a 20* then the user is authenticated.

To use this realm you need to hack up your plexus.properties

authentication-url - The URL you want to authenticate against
url-authentication-default-role - The role given to all users that have authenticated.
url-authentication-email-domain - The domain of the email address of the user, for if 
   the user's id is jcoder, and his email address is jcoder@sonatype.org, then 
   this value would be sonatype.org.  If you want something more then this, you 
   wouldn't be using this realm.

NOTE: Redirects are not followed!

Example:

<snip>

authentication-url=http://host:8081/my-authentication-service/
url-authentication-default-role=my-auth-role
url-authentication-email-domain=sonatype.org

</snip>

NOTE: This Realm is compatable with Nexus 1.3
